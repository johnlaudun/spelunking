Here's something of an abstract of what I have in mind:

Paremiological Trawling: Using Large Language Models to Map Emergent Proverbs

If proverbs are short, generally known phrases or clauses in a fixed and memorizable form that repeat across time and space, then it follows that buried within the probabilistic matrices of word collocations that make up large language models there should be a way to unearth hitherto un- or under-observed proverbs: that is, n-grams of sufficient length that the probability of 8 to 20 words "sticking" together and emerging out of a large number of responses rises above the level of random results. (Please note that the use of "emergence" here is not in line with the notion of "emergent abilities" that appears in some of the NLP/LLM literature.) 

What I propose to do is to devise a collection of prompts designed to elicit such long n-grams as would include the possibility of proverbs and then take those results and certify them by searching for them in actual use in those texts available on the public web -- some LLMs have been trained on closed sources (e.g., JSTOR) where such searches would be impossible. 

The goal of this project is to determine if LLMs can be used either as a tool to make or as a map itself of culture. Given just how much these things have ingested, given the nature of how not only transformers (the underlying technology) work but also that today's LLMs have been trained and tweaked over a number of generations, it is not clear how useful such an enterprise can
