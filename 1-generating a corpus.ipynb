      "There isn’t a single, universally agreed “meaning of life,” because the answer depends on what you treat as authoritative: biology, philosophy, religion, or your own values. Here are a few of the most common, workable lenses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Biological/evolutionary:** Life “means” to persist and reproduce; meaning is an emergent human interpretation layered on top of survival.\n",
      "- **Religious/spiritual:** Meaning comes from relationship to the divine, fulfilling a purpose, cultivating virtue, serving others, or seeking liberation/enlightenment (varies by tradition).\n",
      "- **Existentialist:** There is no built-in meaning; you **create** it through choices, commitments, and taking responsibility for your life.\n",
      "- **Humanist/psychological:** Meaning often tracks three elements: **connection** (love/belonging), **contribution** (helping/creating), and **coherence** (a story that makes sense of your experiences).\n",
      "- **Absurdist:** The universe may be indifferent, but you can live boldly anyway—finding joy and integrity without needing ultimate answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A practical synthesis many people find satisfying is: **to live in a way that reduces needless suffering and increases flourishing—through love, learning, creation, and service—while becoming more fully yourself.**\n",
      "\n",
      "If you tell me what kind of answer you want (philosophical, religious, scientific, or personal/practical), and what you value most (freedom, love, achievement, peace, justice, etc.), I can tailor it.\n"
